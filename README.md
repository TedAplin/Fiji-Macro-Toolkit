## About
This is a set of ImageJ macros for completing commonly used ImageJ functions on an entire folder of images.

Batch processing macros are an important aspect of any kind of experiment with multiple Images present for a number of reasons.
* It is faster
* Allows for other work to be done while it runs in the background
* Massively reduces the chance of error
* Ensures that all files are correctly processed in the same way
* Makes your workflow substnatially more reproduceable and transparent

The aim of this project is to have a robust toolkit which is easy to use for even those with no ImageJ experience and can compute large volumes of images even with limited computational power.
I have also added templates which can be used to create your own macros from with instructions at the bottom. I hope this will allow people who have never used ImageJ macros before to be able to produce their own batch processing macros.

They all work on Windows and Linux, and should work on Mac too, but I have not had the opportunity to test this.

Most of these Macros only work with .tif input files, but there is a macro to convert images from other proprietary formats to .tif and one of the macro templates contains this functionality.
